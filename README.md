# DREAS – DeepRockEncryptionAsService

**Enterprise-Grade Agentic AI Security Framework**  
_Built with Rust, Secured by Google Cloud KMS & HSM, Multi-Language Ready_

***

## Overview

**DREAS (DeepRockEncryptionAsService)** is an advanced agentic AI architecture delivering robust, enterprise-grade encryption and governance. Leveraging Google Cloud KMS with HSM-backed keys, DREAS ensures that all agent prompts, user responses, and sensitive artifacts are encrypted at all stages—providing true privacy, fine-grained policy enforcement, and end-to-end auditability.  
Built first in Rust for its performance and security, DREAS is also ready for hybrid Python/Golang extensions.

***

## Key Features

- **Zero-Trust Encryption:** Everything at rest and in transit is encrypted via GCP HSM-backed KMS keys.
- **Agentic AI Governance:** Prompts, LLM responses, and sensitive agent data are strictly access-controlled and auditable.
- **Key Escrow & Break-Glass:** Regulatory-compliant key escrow, immutable audit, and recourse for disaster/RTO scenarios.
- **Multi-Language Extensible:** Core in Rust, optional modules in Python/Go.
- **Enterprise Storage Ready:** Native support for CMEK-enabled BigQuery and GCS (gs://...), plus secure extension points.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (1.70+), plus _optionally_ Python 3.10+ or Go 1.20+
- **Google Cloud**: KMS, HSM, BigQuery, GCS permissions (least privilege)
- **CLI tools**: `gcloud`, `gsutil`, `bq`

### Setup

- Clone this repo.
- Edit `config/config.toml`:
```toml
[gcp]
project_id = "your-project-id"
kms_key_uri = "projects/../cryptoKeys/../cryptoKeyVersions/1"
location = "us-central1"
```
- Register an HSM-backed key in GCP KMS
- Grant your DREAS agent service account only the minimum required IAM privileges.

### Build & Run

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo run --bin api_service
```

***

## Security Model

- **CMEK+HSM for all secrets:** Prompts, responses, user info, etc. are always encrypted before storage or transmission.
- **No persistent raw keys/secrets:** Only in-memory during active session/decryption, under identity control.
- **Audit, compliance & escrow:** All access is logged; break-glass/escrow strictly requires multi-party authorization; no silent privilege escalation is possible.
